## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. **Firebase Configuration**

1. Create a new Firebase project at [https://console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Enable **Firestore Database** and **Authentication**
3. Copy your Firebase configuration object
4. Replace the configuration in `js/firebase-config.js`:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "your-actual-api-key",
    authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com", 
    projectId: "your-project-id",
    storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "123456789",
    appId: "your-app-id"
};
```

### 2. **Firestore Database Setup**

Create the following collections in your Firestore database:

```
- recipes/
- nutritionLogs/
- healthMetrics/
- mealPlans/
- shoppingLists/
- userPreferences/
- recipeRatings/
```

### 3. **Firebase Security Rules**

Set up basic security rules in Firestore:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. **Authentication Setup**

Enable **Anonymous Authentication** in Firebase Console:
- Go to Authentication > Sign-in method
- Enable Anonymous authentication
- This allows users to use the app without registration

### 5. **Local Development**

1. **Clone/Download** all project files to your local directory
2. **Open** `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. The app will automatically sign in anonymously and initialize AI algorithms

### 6. **Web Server Setup (Optional)**

For full functionality, serve the files through a web server:

```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (install live-server globally)
npm install -g live-server
live-server

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
